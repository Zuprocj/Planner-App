## How It Works

The user has access to two pages: Three Day Planner and Fun Page

| Three Day Planner                     | Fun Page                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Adds the three day planner TODO       | Renders all axios calls in each card          |
| Gives the time remaining for the TODO | Another API data can be seen with next button |
| Save TODO to the Mongo database       | Gives the weather details with date and time  |

## Installation

```
To run this application locally, use http://localhost:3000 after completing the following steps.

- git clone

NOTE: Facebook's command to install a react app is `npx create-react-app` NOT `npm create-react-app`

```

## Motivation:

1. Organize a day more meaningfully
2. Organize priorities by today/ tomorrow/ day-after tomorrow
3. Organise with time frame
